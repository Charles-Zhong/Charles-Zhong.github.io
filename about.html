Thank you for visiting my little shitty website! I am Zhehua Zhong, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. I am currently studying at Hangzhou Dianzi University, third year of my master's degree. My research focuses on AI security in the field of natural language processing. In terms of algorithm, I am good at deep learning and game theory, while my common languages for code development are Python and C++. My personal highlights include winning the third prize in the China Graduate Mathematical Modeling Competition and the Zhejiang Provincial Government Scholarship, as well as several patents and a paper under review at the Top Conference (ICLR).

Please feel free to browse and remember to come back frequently. The site is still under continuous construction!
