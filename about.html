Thank you for visiting my little shitty website! I am Zhehua Zhong, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, currently studying in Hangzhou University of Electronic Science and Technology, third year of master. My research interests are AI security problems in nlp. In terms of algorithms, I am good at deep learning, game theory and convex optimization; my common development languages are Python and C++. My personal highlights include winning the third prize at the national level in the China Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling Competition, winning the Zhejiang Provincial Government Scholarship during my undergraduate years, and having several public patents. In addition, my research results during my master's degree have been submitted to the top conference in artificial intelligence (ICLR) and are still under review.

Please feel free to browse and remember to come back frequently. The site is still under continuous construction!
